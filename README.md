ðŸ”¹ 1. Introduction

In hostels, colleges, canteens, and mess services, managing daily meals and providing meal tokens is a common requirement. Traditionally, mess staff manually writes menus and issues handwritten tokens, which is time-consuming and error-prone.

Your project solves this by providing a Mess Admin Dashboard where the admin can:

Add/update the daily menu.

Generate and print meal tokens (like receipts).

Keep track of the number of tokens issued.

View simple reports at the end of the day.

ðŸ”¹ 2. Objectives

To digitalize mess management and reduce manual effort.

To allow mess admin to update and display the daily menu easily.

To generate unique meal tokens that can be printed like receipts.

To keep records of meals served for analysis and reporting.

To build a simple and user-friendly system for non-technical staff.
